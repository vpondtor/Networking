Today I'm working on getting a stream of communication between the server and client.

I'm using TCP which may not be ideal, but thata's ok

Issues
- Server only listens on localhost
- Figure out how to print the info of the connecting client

Questions
- Defining a struct vs. defining a pointer to a struct?

For now just worry about creating and maintaining connections
Don't worry about actually reading + writing from them

Tomorrow
- Add a command line interface
